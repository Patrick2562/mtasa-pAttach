# pAttach
Optimized bone attach thanks to the new MTA functions/events.

This resource doesn't match with well known bone_attach, you can not use the same parameters!

# Performance Comparison
\- There are not so much similiar resources but I will run some performance tests on them.
CPU usages (Ryzen 5 2600), streamed-in/out attached objects to a ped, on default MTA server with play gamemode.

# How to use
\- Server sided example to attach objects (parachute, weapon, hat) to player.

```lua
addCommandHandler("testattach", function(player)
    local backpack = createObject(371, 0, 0, 0)
    exports.pAttach:attach(backpack, player, "backpack", 0, -0.15, 0, 0, 90, 0)

    local weaponRight = createObject(3965, 0, 0, 0)
    exports.pAttach:attach(weaponRight, player, "weapon")

    local weaponLeft = createObject(3965, 0, 0, 0)
    exports.pAttach:attach(weaponLeft, player, 34, 0.02, 0.05, 0, 20, 190, 190)

    local hat = createObject(1265, 0, 0, 0)
    setObjectScale(hat, 0.5)
    exports.pAttach:attach(hat, player, "head", 0.1, -0.05, 0, 0, 90, 0)
end)
```
